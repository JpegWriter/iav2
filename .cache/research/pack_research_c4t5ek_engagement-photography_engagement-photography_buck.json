Make sure everything is all ready the day before so you aren’t scrounging up your clothes in the morning, you don’t want to be flustered before your shoot! Since these are your engagement pictures you know I’m going to want to shoot that bling! 7. Try on your outfit a couple days before the shoot, you want to make sure that you still feel great in it. I do my very best to make sure your pictures don’t look “posed.” Instead, I will give you a direction and tell you what to do and then you make it your own.",
